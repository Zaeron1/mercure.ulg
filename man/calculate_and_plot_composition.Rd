\title{Calculate and Plot Composition}
\usage{
calculate_and_plot_composition()
}
\description{
This function calculates the mean composition of various elements from provided matrices
representing different chemical layers. It then plots a pie chart to visually represent
the composition of Mercury's surface using Plotly.
}
\details{
The function retrieves data from specific layers of a given result array. It calculates
the mean values for each matrix and determines the relative percentage composition of
elements such as Si, Mg, Ca, Al, Fe, and S. The resulting composition is then plotted
as a pie chart.

The matrices are extracted from layers of an external array `result_array`. Each layer
represents a specific chemical component of Mercury's surface.
}
\note{
Ensure that the `result_array` is loaded in the environment and that the indices specified
correspond to the correct layers. The Plotly library must be installed and loaded for the
pie chart to be displayed.
